@Test(enabled=false)- If we have [enabled=false] next to a test annotation then this test case will not run when we will run the runner file.


DropDown:

To test the dropdown of a webpage use the Select class. We can use .selectByVisibleText AND .selectByIndex to find a specific element


MouseHover:

An image or hyperlink that appears when a cursor is moved over a specific point on a web page.

MouseHover means when you go to any tab and some other pages pops in, those scenarios can be tested by mouseHover.

In Ebay’s case- if you move your cursor to ‘Fashion’- you will other options came up.In those scenario, we will use mouseHover.

We can add the method below in CommonAPI:

 public void mouseHover(String locator) {
        WebElement element = getElementByLinkText(locator);
        Actions actions = new Actions(driver);
        actions.moveToElement(element).build().perform();
    }

* Whenever we import Action class- we need to get the web driver object/instance.
* Whenever we call an Actions class we need to call build().perform();


Scroll Through a WebPage:

In most websites we need to scroll down to view other contents. In those scenario we can use below method:


Notes:

arguments[0].scrollIntoView(true) - change the name .scrollIntoView according to the method name. If the method name is different then we need to change .scrollIntoView to whatever the
method name is.

Another way to scrolling:
@Test
    public void testScrolling() {
        JavascriptExecutor javascriptExecutor = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;
        javascriptExecutor.executeScript("window.scrollBy(0,1000)");
        sleepFor(10);}
